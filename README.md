# NPSP-Data-Importer-Documentation
Review and revise the HTML documentation to better communicate the who, what, where and why of the NPSP Data Importer and its related components. Supplement other resources

Goals
1. Identify and evaluate which pages should be deleted and which should be revised. Check with .Org team for their list.
2. Work with NPSP videography to create a cohesive introductory path that makes importing into the NPSP data more understandable.
3. Pick 3 to 5 critical help documentation and make drafts to review; incorporate graphics or visuals if useful.
